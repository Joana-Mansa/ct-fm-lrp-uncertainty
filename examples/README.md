# Real benchmark examples

`data_samples.npz` contains a small, deterministic selection from the official MedMNIST 64-pixel release: the first test example of each class. These are real processed benchmark inputs, not diffusion-generated images.

```python
import numpy as np
samples = np.load("examples/data_samples.npz")
print(samples.files)  # images, labels, test_indices
print(samples["images"].shape, samples["images"].dtype)
image = samples["images"][0]
model_input = image.astype("float32") / 127.5 - 1.0
```

[The manifest](data_manifest.json) records the source URL, official archive MD5, SHA-256, split counts and exact sample indices. `python scripts/preview_data.py` regenerates the README preview using NumPy and Matplotlib only.
